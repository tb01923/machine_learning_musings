A I Or Robotics,"Artificial intelligence is intelligence demonstrated by computers, as opposed to human or animal intelligence. ""Intelligence"" encompasses the ability to learn and to reason, to generalize, and to infer meaning.
AI can process large amounts of data in ways that humans cannot. The goal for AI is to be able to do things like recognize patterns, make decisions, and judge like humans.
Some Example of AI include
1. Using virtual filters on faces when taking pictures and using face ID for unlocking our phones.
2. Tools such as Grammarly, AI algorithms use machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing to identify incorrect usage of language and suggest corrections.
3. AI chatbots. The programmed algorithms enable machines to answer frequently asked questions, take and track orders, and direct calls. Conversational chatbots are taught to impersonate the conversational styles of customer representatives through natural language processing (NLP). Simple usages can be a customer looking for quotes, seeking to file an insurance claim, or simply trying to pay their premium.

Future uses of AI include:
ChatGBT, autonomous vehicles, Personalized medicine, etc.
For example, a customer wants to change the home address on her policy. She can say, â€œI want to change my address.â€ Chatbot Assistant technology is able to interpret the customerâ€™s intent and transfer a clear instruction then executes the command that updates the new address.",Released,Info-M 2.11, , ,_2022x_1_eb7034d_1690314630859_297260_196910,AF_IM 2.x,AF_IM 2.x::ACORD Information Model 2.11::Party::Virtual Party Detail Subtypes::AI or Robotics,Class,Info-M 2.11,Info-M 2.11,Info-M 2.11,acordGlossaryTerm, ,

Absolute exclusions,"""Absolute"" exclusions are Exclusions found within certain insurance policy forms, precluding coverage for claims that are remotelyâ€”but not directlyâ€”related to the actual nature of the exclusion. The effect of such language is to defeat coverage in situations where it could be reasonably expected that coverage would apply. For example, an absolute exclusion in a policy written to cover insurance agents' errors and omissions (E&O) exposures might read as follows: ""This Policy does not apply to any 'Claim' against the 'Insured' ... based on or directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to any actual or alleged 'bodily injury.'"" Assume, for example, that an insurance agent failed to secure bodily injury (BI) liability coverage for a client and the client is later held liable for BI. The client then sues the agent for failing to obtain an appropriate insurance policy. Given the wording of the ""absolute"" exclusion noted above, the agent's policy may not respond to the claim. This is because the client's allegation indirectly arose from and was ""related to"" BI. In recent years, these ""absolute"" exclusions have become more common, and insurers have, with increasing frequency, been using them to deny coverage of claims that would otherwise appear to be covered.",Released,Glos-M 2.7,IRMI, ,_2022x_1_eb7034d_1690314628938_343279_182654,Glossary Of Terms,AF_Glossary 2.x::ACORD Business Glossary 2.13::A::Absolute exclusions,Glossary Term,Glos-M 2.7,,Glos-M 2.7,acordGlossaryTerm, ,

Additional Insured,"A person or organization not automatically included as an insured under an insurance policy who is included or added as an insured under the policy at the request of the named insured. A named insured's impetus for providing additional insured status to others may be a desire to protect the other party because of a close relationship with that party or to comply with a contractual agreement requiring the named insured to do so (e.g., project owners, customers, or owners of property leased by the named insured).
In liability insurance, additional insured status is commonly used in conjunction with an indemnity agreement between the named insured (the indemnitor) and the party requesting additional insured status (the indemnitee). Having the rights of an insured under its indemnitor's commercial general liability (CGL) policy is viewed by most indemnitees as a way of backing up the promise of indemnification. If the indemnity agreement proves unenforceable for some reason, the indemnitee may still be able to obtain coverage for its liability by making a claim directly as an additional insured under the indemnitor's CGL policy. In property insurance, additional insured status is most often used in conjunction with a premises lease agreement between the named insured as the lessee and the owner of the leased building, in which the insured tenant is required to purchase insurance on the leased building and name the building owner as an additional insured on the insurance policy with respect to the leased building.

Additional Interest Type Code,"A code classifying a party's role as an additional interest on an agreement.

NOTE: For property and casualty insurance, the classification of the interest is typically as a third party to the given agreement. For example, an insurance policy covering a dwelling critically involves two parties: (1) the policyholder/insured (2) the insurer. The party in the role of insured on the insurance agreement may also be a participant in a loan agreement, where it plays the role of borrower/mortgagor with another party playing the role of lender/mortgagee. The party acting as the lender in the loan agreement may require it be listed as ""mortgagee"" on the insurance agreement covering the dwelling. In this scenario, the party acting as the lender in the loan agreement has an additional interest in the insurance agreement and is accounted for as some type of additional interest or third party on the insurance agreement. Such additional interests may be classified for clarity on the insurance agreement. The lender plays the primary/first party role of ""mortgagee"" on the loan agreement. On the insurance agreement, the lender is playing a third party/additional interest role that can be classified as ""mortgagee"".",Released,Info-M 2.1, , ,_2022x_1_eb7034d_1690314625968_360415_160675,AF_IM 2.x,AF_IM 2.x::ACORD Information Model 2.11::Agreement::Party Role In Agreement Subtypes::AdditionalInterest::typeCode,Property,Info-M 2.1,Info-M 2.4,Info-M 2.4,acordGlossaryTerm, ,

    <p>
An Interlocking Clause defines a provision in a reinsurance agreement designed to allocate loss from a single occurrence between two or more reinsurance agreements. The provision is intended to be used when the company purchases its excess of loss reinsurance on an underwriting year or risks attaching basis. The provision allows the re insured to prorate its retention between two or more reinsurance agreement periods, i.e., when one loss affects policies assigned to different reinsurance periods, so that the company will have one retention and one recovery for the loss involving the two reinsurance periods.&#160; This clause in a reinsurance treaty is designed to mesh and apportion loss from a single occurrence between two or more reinsurance contracts. The exact opposite is the event approach, designed to cause all loss from one occurrence to have one deemed date of loss, regardless of the number of dates of loss or reinsurance contracts involved.&#160; Under an excess of loss cover on Issued and Renewed (Risks Attaching) basis, the Reassured would be exposed to two loss retentions (deductibles) if the same loss occurrence were to involve policies issued in two different underwriting years. The Interlocking Clause provides for pro rata distribution of the Ultimate Net Loss over the two years in such cases and apportionment of the limits based on such distribution: Excess of Loss Limits 500,000 XS 100,000 each and every loss occurrence.&#160;&#160; Loss from the ground up 300,000 from the same event (involving 2 underwriting years)

Agreement Content Change Activity,"An activity to maintain the contractual content of a financial services agreement. Depending on the kind of maintenance applied to the financial services agreement, such an activity may or may not generate the issue of a new version of the financial services agreement. 

For example, a modification to the premium or the beneficiary of an insurance policy will trigger the issue of a new version of the policy, while a change in the address of the policyholder will not necessarily do. 
 
e.g: Endorsement Request: A request to add or subtract insurance coverages in an insurance policy. For example, vandalism and malicious mischief can be added to a fire policy through an endorsement. 
 
e.g: Investment Vehicle Allocation Request: A request by which the customer chooses the investment vehicle(s) in which he wishes to invest. Every regular or irregular installment that will be made by the customer will be allocated to the contractually-defined investment vehicle(s). 
 
e.g: Partial Surrender Request: A request to pay out a portion of the accumulated value of the insurance agreement. The coverages of the policy stay in effect, the value of some of the coverages may be decreased. 
 
e.g: Pledge Request: A request to transfer the cash value of a life insurance policy from the policyholder to the policyholder's creditor as security for a loan. 
 
e.g: Renewal Deferral Request: A request to defer the renewal of an insurance policy. Payment of the renewal premium is suspended and the policy is not renewed. The policy can be reactivated by payment of the renewal premium after the deferral period. 
 
e.g: Reversion Request: A request to pay an annuity to another designated beneficiary at the death of the annuitant.

The fact that they are participants in the group does not mean they are covered; rather, this is simply an acknowledgment of those who are eligible for the group insurance.

Agreement Grouping,"A logical grouping of agreements. A agreement grouping can be decomposed directly in agreement or in further agreement components. The grouping of agreements either satisfies a set of criteria, or forms a group as a result of a human decision.  Agreement grouping can also be used to specify agreement that controls other agreements. 
 
Examples: 
Gathering all the agreements issued for earthquake  coverage
The grouping of all the insurance policies to be re-insured under a reinsurance treaty.
Broker John's portfolio of car insurance policies.
The grouping of several multi-national insurance agreements (one per country), all belonging to the same party (e.g. agreement holder/insured) within a portfolio.
Workers Compensation is a highly regulated line of business in the US market. If a company has operations in only one state, it will likely purchase one policy per that state's Work Comp requirements. If the operations involve multiple states, then the number of work comp policies required will vary based on which states have relationships with other states regarding multiple state coverage on one policy. Some states do not allow for this. Hence a company doing business in all 50 states might need to purchase 20 work comp policies to cover all of its employees (some of those policies would be state-specific and others would cover two or more states). There is a need to view the 20 policies as a collection of agreements.

Examples:

e.g: Cancellation Request: A request that leads to the end of the financial services agreement. Such a request can be initiated by the customer or by the modeled organization. In the latter case, different circumstances may exist, such as the nonrenewable of the next insurance agreement term for underwriting reasons, the termination of a pending insurance agreement due to non-acceptance of the risk, the nonrenewable of a credit card agreement due to the customer's bad reimbursement history.

e.g: Full Surrender Request: A request that leads to the end of the financial services agreement. The accumulated value of the insurance agreement minus surrender charges is paid out to the insured and all the coverages provided under the insurance agreement are ended.

e.g: Lapse Request: A request to put the financial services agreement in a lapse status. In insurance, such a request may be triggered by the non-payment of premiums. Lapse processing may include the execution of non-forfeiture or exit options if there is cash value.

e.g: Maturity Request: A request to put a financial services agreement in a matured status. Typically, in life insurance, a maturity request is triggered when life insurance death proceeds or endowments are paid, either at the death of an insured or at the end of the endowment period.

e.g: Policy Conversion Request: Converts a policy to another policy, ending the first one, creating a new policy and transferring value from the ended to the new policy. Typically done for changing to a different product, like for instance when moving the value of a group pension policy to an individual annuity policy.

e.g: Quote Request: A request for a price estimate for a financial services agreement. In the case of insurance, a quote is a price estimate for an insurance cover, typically requested by a prospective customer to explore insurance alternatives and to obtain a quick rate quotation.

e.g: Reactivation Request: A request to reestablish a financial services agreement's in-force status after suspension.

e.g: Reinstatement Request: A request to place a previously lapsed financial services agreement back in force. In the case of an insurance policy, the insurance policy may have lapsed because of non-payment of premiums, or be a life insurance agreement that continues as extended term or reduced paid-up insurance.

e.g: Renewal Request: A request to renew a preexisting financial services agreement. Typically, in insurance, it represents the request for automatically reestablishing an insurance policy's in-force status, usually achieved through payment of the premium due.

e.g: Suspension Request: A request to place an financial services agreement in a suspend state. This means that no externally requested or automatic life-cycle event for this financial services agreement is further possible. The request may be initiated by the customer (for a limited period of time), by a producer or servicer (e.g. for the processing of a pending death claim), or by the modeled organization (e.g. whenever the withdrawals on a credit card have exceeded the withdrawal limit for a period of time).

Bystander Claim,"A type of liability claim in which an accident bystander suffers some form of mental anguish due to witnessing this event. Whether a witness's emotional distress and trauma falls under the definition of ""bodily injury"" may arise in a court case. Some auto accidents involve situations in which one person suffers severe bodily injury, and another occupant may walk away with minor scratches. In that case, the uninjured occupants may make a claim for emotional distress or trauma from witnessing the injuries to the other passengers. Another example would be a mother who witnesses her small child being mauled by a neighborhood dog. Some courts recognize these types of claims if (a) the witness was located at or near the scene of the accident, (b) the mental anguish resulted from a direct emotional impact upon the witness from the sensory observance of the event, and (c) the witness and the victim were closely related (e.g., mother and child), as contrasted with a more distant relationship.

e.g: Benefit calculations are used for fixed-contribution products, for which the premium amount is decided by the customer. 
 
e.g: Commission calculations can be of different kinds: initial commissions are calculated at the creation of the agreement, while renewal commissions are calculated at every policy anniversary. You will also have different calculations for charges taken from the policy and commission expenses paid to the intermediaries. 

e.g: Initialization calculations are general calculations executed at the creation of the agreement. An example would be to calculate the value of deductible properties. 

e.g: Premium calculations are executed when the agreements are created. They can also be executed later on, for example at every renewal or when special events occur that have an impact on the agreements.

e.g: Profit share calculations are usually executed at policy anniversary dates to determine how much of the company's profit the policyholder is entitled to. 

e.g: Reserve calculations are usually calculated on the anniversary dates of a life insurance policy. They can also be calculated on demand, for example when a customer wants to surrender a life insurance policy, or to stop paying the premium so that the policy becomes paid-up. 

e.g: Surrender value calculations are executed in order to determine how much the policy is worth when a customer wants to surrender a life-insurance policy.

An Insurance Company, issues a three-year catastrophe bonds for $1M with annual interest payments of 8%. The bond insures a company from hurricane damages that exceed $1M. 
If the hurricane damages to the company don't exceed $1M or the catastrophic event does not occur, then the bond investor gets 8% interest payments for 3 years. After three years when the bond matures, the investor is repaid the initial investment of $1M plus the interest.
However, if a major catastrophic event occurs within the 3 year period and damages exceed $1M, the insurance company may need to use the $1M from the investor to cover the damages.

A hurricane causes 25 cars to be totally demolished, resulting in a loss of $75,000. Company B is liable for $25,000.

e.g. You may have a Category called ""US-States"" with 50 values in the CategoryScheme, A single CategoryScheme may be associated to more than one logical Category such as ""Insured Domicile State"" and ""Claim Location State""

TO-DO:  Create a example explaining how you could model category roll-ups to sub-category roll-ups such as geographies, etc.
More complex case of sub-categories, 
Explain this: In other words, a category can be further partitioned into several subcategories according to different criteria, each of which is represented by a category scheme.

For example, assume that a policy containing a claims-made coverage trigger is written with a term of January 1, 2015-2016. Coverage will apply to claims made against the insured during this time period. 

Claims-made coverage is in contrast to policies written with an occurrence trigger, whereby coverage applies to incidents occurring while the policy is in force - regardless of when the claim arising out of that incident is made against the insured. Thus, under an occurrence policy with a term of January 1, 2015-2016, coverage would apply to claims arising from incidents that occurred during the January 1, 2015-2016, period, irrespective of when the claims are made against the insured or reported to the insurer.

Coverage Retroactive Start Date Time,"A provision found in many (although not all) claims-made policies that eliminates coverage for claims produced by wrongful acts that took place prior to a specified date, even if the claim is first made during the policy period. 

For example, a January 1, 2010, retroactive date in a policy written with a January 1, 2010-2011, term, would bar coverage for claims resulting from wrongful acts that took place prior to January 1, 2010, even if claims (resulting from such acts) are made against the insured during the January 1, 2010-2011, policy period. 

There are two purposes of retroactive dates: (1) to eliminate coverage for situations or incidents known to insureds that have the potential to give rise to claims in the future and (2) to preclude coverage for ""stale"" claims that arise from events far in the past, even if such events are unknown to the insured. In the former case, the retroactive date preserves the principle of ""fortuity"" -that is, the insurer should not be called upon to cover the so-called burning building. In the latter instance, the retroactive date makes policies more affordable by precluding coverage for events that, while insurable, are remote in time.",Released,Info-M 2.1,IRMI, ,_2022x_1_eb7034d_1690314629765_850743_188301,AF_IM 2.x,AF_IM 2.x::ACORD Information Model 2.11::Agreement::Agreement Component Subtypes::Coverage::retroactiveStartDateTime,Property,Info-M 2.1,Info-M 2.5,Info-M 2.7,acordGlossaryTerm, ,

Coverholder,"In the United Kingdom, insurers enter into agreements with coverholders. These brokers act as agents for insurers, writing insurance contracts on their behalf and serving as their local representatives. Coverholders enable insurers to extend their geographic reach by benefiting from local knowledge of risks and market conditions in other parts of the UK or the world. (1)

A ""Coverholder"" means a company or partnership authorized by a managing agent to enter into a contract or contracts of insurance to be underwritten by the members of a syndicate managed by it in accordance with the terms of a binding authority. There are two types of coverholder at Lloyd's namely ""Approved Coverholders"" and ""Restricted Coverholders"". In addition, some Approved Coverholders may also be classified as ""Service Company Coverholders"". Lloyd's rules provide for the type of binding authority that each of these types of coverholder may be granted. (2)

A coverholder is party role with authority to bind risks to an original Master Cover contract or Binding Authority. The role is one where, on behalf on an insurance company, the party assumes responsibilities including and not limited to: underwriting risks, administering policies, collecting premiums, servicing and paying claims. The coverholder and the insurance company typically have a separate contractual relationship that outlines details of the types of risks etc. the coverholder can underwrite and administer on the insurance company's behalf, and also the extent of the administration activity they undertake.

One example of a coverholder is an MGA (managing general agent) in the USA, to whom authority has been delegated to underwrite and administer surplus lines risks on behalf of insurers such as Lloyd's syndicates and surplus lines insurers. In this example the original producer is generally the insurance agent, who takes a risk to an MGA when they cannot get coverage in the particular State where the risk is located. However, examples outside USA will often see the coverholder marketing directly to insured's rather than relying on risks fed from normal agents.

Whether acting as an agent (producer) for an insurance company based on authorization granted by the insurance company, or acting as a producer on behalf of another producer, a coverholder is a producer.",Released,Info-M 2.3,eHow; Lloyd's, ,_2022x_1_eb7034d_1690314626866_459678_166838,AF_IM 2.x,AF_IM 2.x::ACORD Information Model 2.11::Role and Relationship::Service Provider Subtypes::Coverholder,Class,Info-M 2.3,Info-M 2.7,Info-M 2.7,acordGlossaryTerm,AF_IM 2.x::ACORD Information Model 2.11::Role and Relationship::Service Provider Subtypes::InsuranceProducer,

For example, suppose a property policy includes a $10,000 aggregate deductible. The insured sustains three losses during the policy period. The first two losses ($4,000 and $6,000) fall within the deductible so the insured business pays them itself. The insurer pays the third loss (for $5,000) in full.

Deductible Type Code List Disappearing,"Disappearing Deductible â€” a formula deductible that decreases as the amount of loss increases and disappears entirely to provide full coverage when the loss reaches a specified amount. Disappearing deductibles were once commonly used in property insurance policies.

For example, deductible will â€œvanishâ€ or decrease the longer you drive without an accident. It means youâ€™ll pay less if you do get into an accident. Itâ€™s a way to encourage and reward safe driving. Staying accident-free will earn you a $50 to $100 discount off your annual collision deductible. i.e.
1. Your collision deductible: $1,000
2. Annual vanishing deductible discount for safe driving: $100
3. Your deductible after the first year of safe driving: $900
4. Your deductible after five years of safe driving: $500

If your deductible is $500, then thereâ€™s a possibility itâ€™ll go down to $0 after five years of safe driving.

Deductible Type Code List Percent,"A percentage deductible often applies to perils that can cause catastrophic losses. An example is earthquake. When earthquake is a covered peril and a loss occurs, the loss is typically reduced by a deductible that applies on a percentage basis. The deductible may be a percentage of the limit or the value of the damaged property. 

For example, suppose that a building is insured under a Difference in Conditions policy that covers earthquake. The earthquake limit is $500,000 and the deductible is 15% of the building limit. If the building sustains $250,000 in earthquake damage, the insurer will pay $175,000 ($250,000 - $75,000) and the policyholder will pay the $75,000 deductible.",Released,Info-M 2.8, , ,_2022x_1_eb7034d_1690314625445_736253_156319,AF_IM 2.x,AF_IM 2.x::ACORD Information Model 2.11::Product Specification::Product Specification Code Lists::DeductibleTypeCodeList::Percent,EnumerationLiteral,Info-M 2.2,Info-M 2.2,Info-M 2.2,acordGlossaryTerm, ,

Duty to defend,"A term used to describe an insurer's obligation to provide an insured with defense to claims made under a liability insurance policy. As a general rule, an insured need only establish that there is potential for coverage under a policy to give rise to the insurer's duty to defend. Therefore, the duty to defend may exist even where coverage is in doubt and ultimately does not apply. Implicit in this rule is the principle that an insurer's duty to defend an insured is broader than its duty to indemnify. Moreover, an insurer may owe a duty to defend its insured against a claim in which ultimately no damages are awarded, and any doubt as to whether the facts support a duty to defend is usually resolved in the insured's favor.
On the other hand, non-duty to defend policies require only that the insurer reimburse the insured for funds expended by the insured in defending a claim.",Released,Glos-M 2.7, , ,_2022x_1_eb7034d_1690314626895_965129_167106,Glossary Of Terms,AF_Glossary 2.x::ACORD Business Glossary 2.13::D::Duty to defend,Glossary Term,Glos-M 2.7,,Glos-M 2.7,acordGlossaryTerm, ,

Ensuing Loss,"It is a loss that ensues from an earlier loss. In first party property insurance contracts, the ""ensuing loss"" concept comes into play when the initial loss is excluded, such as in the case of mold, water damage, or when a defective design causes the loss. When another loss ensues from the first excluded cause of loss, the intent of ""ensuing loss"" is to allow coverage for such ensuing damage.
Ensuing loss clauses were developed after the San Francisco earthquake of 1906. Earth movement caused about $80 million in property damage. Gas emitted from pipes broken during the shaking sparked a fire, which spread to the rest of the city and caused another $400 million in other property damage (in 1906 dollars). Symbolically: earth movement (excluded peril) â†’ earthquake damage (excluded loss) â†’ fire (covered peril) â†’ fire damage (ensuing loss). Insurers argued that under the ordinary ""proximate cause"" rule, the earth movement was the peril that set the ""chain of events in motion,"" and that because earth movement was excluded, the fire damage was excluded, too. After the San Francisco earthquake, the California legislature enacted a set of statutes to prevent insurers from disclaiming coverage for fires ensuing from earthquakes. To comply with these and similar statutes in other states, first-party insurers added exceptions to their earthquake exclusions preserving coverage for ensuing fires. Later, ensuing loss exceptions were incorporated into many other types of exclusions.",Released,Glos-M 2.7, , ,_2022x_1_eb7034d_1690314626754_731160_165835,Glossary Of Terms,AF_Glossary 2.x::ACORD Business Glossary 2.13::E::Ensuing Loss,Glossary Term,Glos-M 2.7,,Glos-M 2.7,acordGlossaryTerm, ,

Excess Of Loss Treaty Agreement,"Excess of Loss Treaty.
Excess of loss reinsurance is a method whereby an insurer pays the amount of each claim for each risk up to a limit determined in advance and the reinsurer pays the amount of the claim above that limit up to a specific sum. For example, assume that an insurer issues automobile liability policies of $150,000 on any one risk and retains the first $50,000 of any risk. The insurer purchases excess loss reinsurance for $100,000 in excess of $50,000 on any one risk. The insurer pays the first $50,000 of all losses, and the reinsurer pays any excess amount up to a maximum of $100,000.

Low or working layer excess of loss reinsurance: Reinsurance that absorbs the losses immediately above the reinsured's retention layer. A low layer excess of loss reinsurer will pay up to a certain monetary amount at which point a higher layer reinsurer or the ceding company will be liable for additional losses. Also known as working layer reinsurance.",Released,Info-M 2.1, , ,_2022x_1_eb7034d_1690314624754_889855_150794,AF_IM 2.x,AF_IM 2.x::ACORD Information Model 2.11::Agreement::Reinsurance Treaty Agreement Subtypes::ExcessOfLossTreatyAgreement,Class,Info-M 2.1,Info-M 2.6,Info-M 2.6,acordGlossaryTerm,AF_IM 2.x::ACORD Information Model 2.11::Agreement::Reinsurance Treaty Agreement Subtypes::NonProportionalTreatyAgreement,

Excess Of Loss Treaty Agreement Backed Up Excess Of Loss Treaty Agreement,"This represents the agreement that is backed-up by another agreement.

Sometimes, the original reinsurer will not agree to more than a certain number of automatic reinstatements - for example, it will agree to only one reinstatement under a catastrophe cover. Alternatively, the cover may be subject to an Annual Aggregate Limit. In such cases, the reassured may face a serious budgeting uncertainty where there are practical difficulties in assessing at inception whether the total cover thus available is sufficient; or the reinsurer is simply not prepared to grant any further cover in advance at an agreed rate. It would be risky for the reassured to wait for the cover to be exhausted before purchasing additional protection. This poses the following dangers from the reassured's point of view:
a) It may be placed in an adverse position if it were to approach the market for an additional reinstatement after the original protection is exhausted. Apart from the danger of further losses in quick succession, it will obviously be in a seller's market and may have to pay an unexpected price. 
b) Apart from the uncertainty of the cost of such protection after a number of claims have already occurred, the time available for arranging protection may be insufficient (e.g. - per risk protection exhausted by a catastrophe).
c) The danger is particularly serious in the case of long tail covers with an IBNR potential, where the period may have expired before the reassured realizes that the cover is exhausted. It would be prohibitively costly to purchase retroactive protection in such cases, or such cover may not be available at all. Under such circumstances, back-up protection can be purchased in advance from another reinsurer for additional reinstatements for an agreed price payable up front. The deductible under this cover will be identical as under the original cover but, in addition.

There is no hard and fast rating formula for this type of protection but the rate would be much lower than the original rate applicable to the underlying cover because 
a) It will be triggered only after the latter is exhausted, the cover being thus effectively subject to an annual aggregate deductible equivalent to the original limit plus the limit under automatic reinstatements; and

Excess Of Loss Treaty Agreement X L Layer Label,"Excessâ€ofâ€loss covers belong to the category of nonproportional reinsurance treaties.

Apart from a cover limit, that is, the maximum coverage per loss (event), further limitations of cover have to be defined to limit the overall loss burden from several losses occurring during the treaty period. These are referred to as reinstatement or the annual aggregate limit (AAL). 
The following peculiarity of longâ€tail business is of particular importance to the design and pricing of nonproportional reinsurance arrangements: the increase in the money amount of the claim during the runâ€off, known as claims inflation.

Facultative Reinsurance Agreement,"Facultative reinsurance is an optional method, under which the direct insurer (ceding company or cedent) offers each risk individually to the reinsurer for his consideration. The reinsurer consequently receives full details of each risk offered, as he would if he were to write it on a direct basis, and he has the option to reject the offer or to agree to acceptance on such terms and conditions as he may prescribe. The offer and acceptance are thus optional on both sides, and there is no valid contract until and unless the offer is accepted.

Facultative reinsurance is the oldest form of reinsurance, having been derived from the concept of coinsurance or sharing of an individual risk by a number of insurers. The basic difference between the two methods is that under the facultative method it is only the primary insurer who has a contractual liability under the original insurance whereas, under coinsurance, each participating insurer has a direct and individual relationship with the original insured - although without any joint or collective liability.

The word 'facultative' means 'optional' or as implying a faculty, that is a 'facility or power to act according to a free choice'. In the early days of reinsurance (up to the middle of the 19th century), reinsurance in UK was effected facultatively between one direct office and another - usually on the basis of reciprocal support through an exchange of risks. However, this situation gave rise to worry in the minds of primary insurers that they were disclosing too much information on their book of business to competitors. This problem was resolved with the emergence of professional reinsurers, who posed no threat of direct competition.
The problem of confidentiality was further eased with the development of the treaty method, which enabled direct insurers to purchase reinsurance without disclosing sensitive details of each risk to the reinsurer. Despite extensive use of treaties, the facultative method is however still employed today owing to the expanding size of risks as also the increase in their hazard and complexity, leading to greater need for consultation between cedent and reinsurer.

Fee disputes exclusion,"An exclusion found within a significant minority of professional liability insurance policies that precludes coverage for claims made against professionals arising from a disagreement about the fees charged by such professionals. The typical sequence of events that produce these types of claims is (a) a client disputes the amount charged by a professional after receiving his or her bill, agreeing to pay only a part of the bill (or perhaps none of it); (b) the professional brings a collection action against the client for the unpaid balance of the bill; and (c) the client responds to the collection action by filing a claim against the professional, alleging that the professional negligently performed the services that are the subject of the dispute. The rationale for excluding claims involving a fee dispute is that insurers consider such matters to be business risks, rather than risks originating from the negligent performance of professional services. Another reason for the exclusion is that insurers view these disputes as largely preventable, provided the professional clearly explains his or her fee structure and obtains the client's agreement to those fees, in advance of actually performing professional services.",Released,Glos-M 2.7,IRMI, ,_2022x_1_eb7034d_1690314627600_135018_172188,Glossary Of Terms,AF_Glossary 2.x::ACORD Business Glossary 2.13::F::Fee disputes exclusion,Glossary Term,Glos-M 2.7,,Glos-M 2.7,acordGlossaryTerm, ,

2. Financial Activities - information about the kinds of financial ""things"" (e.g., processes, transactions) that involve finances (e.g., money, stock, accounting adjustments). The most basic types of activities that involve money coming into or out of the insurance company. 

Underlying the Finance package is the notion of a financial provision. Provision is used to explain how funds are allocated.

Again, the Information Model contains information about these provisions.",Released,, , ,_2022x_1_eb7034d_1690314627256_662199_170183,AF_IM 2.x,AF_IM 2.x::ACORD Information Model 2.11::Finance,Package,,,,acordGlossaryTerm, ,

Financial Advisor,"A financial adviser (UK spelling) or financial advisor (US spelling), more recently often referred to as a financial planner, is a professional who renders financial planning services to individuals, businesses and governments. This can involve investment advice, which may include pension planning, and/or advice on Life insurance and other insurances such as income protection insurance, critical illness insurance etc, and/or advice on mortgages.

Ideally, the financial adviser helps the client maintain the desired balance of investment income, capital gains, and acceptable level of risk by using proper asset allocation. Financial advisers use stock, bonds, mutual funds, real estate investment trusts (REITs), options, futures, notes, and insurance products to meet the needs of their clients. Many financial advisers receive a commission payment for the various financial products that they broker, although ""fee-based"" planning is becoming increasingly popular in the financial services industry.

A further distinction should be made between ""fee-based"" and ""fee-only"" advisers. Fee-based advisers often charge asset based fees but may also collect commissions. Fee-only advisers do not collect commissions or referral fees paid by other product or service providers.

""Client-Centered"" investment advisors only charge a fee based on the assets managed for the client. Typically they charge about 1.0 to 1.5% per year to make the investment decisions for the client.

Financial reinsurance,"Financial Reinsurance (or fin re), is a form of reinsurance which is focused more on capital management than on risk transfer. In the non-life segment of the insurance industry this class of transactions is often referred to as finite reinsurance.
A pure 'fin re' contract for a non-life insurer tends to cover a multi-year period, during which the premium is held and invested by the reinsurer. It is returned to the ceding company - minus a pre-determined profit-margin for the reinsurer - either when the period has elapsed, or when the ceding company suffers a loss. 'Fin re' therefore differs from conventional reinsurance because most of the premium is returned whether there is a loss or not: little or no risk-transfer has taken place.",Released,Glos-M 2.7,Wikipedia,Finite reinsurance; Fin Re,_2022x_1_eb7034d_1690314625229_829287_154311,Glossary Of Terms,AF_Glossary 2.x::ACORD Business Glossary 2.13::F::Financial reinsurance,Glossary Term,Glos-M 2.7,,Glos-M 2.7,acordGlossaryTerm, ,

Fronting Agreement,"Fronting refers to the use of an insurer to issue paper, i.e., an insurance policy, on behalf of a self-insured organization or captive insurer without the intention of bearing any of the risk. 

The risk of loss is transferred back to the self-insured or captive insurer with an indemnity or reinsurance agreement. However, the fronting company (insurer) assumes a credit risk since it would be required to honor the obligations imposed by the policy if the self-insurer or captive failed to indemnify it. Fronting companies charge a fee for this service, generally between 5 and 10 percent of the premium being written. Fronting arrangements allow captives and self-insurers to comply with financial responsibility laws imposed by many states that require evidence of coverage written by an admitted insurer, such as for auto and workers compensation insurance. Fronting arrangements must also be used in business contracts with other organizations, such as leases and construction contracts, where evidence of coverage through an admitted insurer is also required.

Fronting is a device used for circumventing regulatory requirements, whereby an insurer who is not licensed in a particular country or state employs the services of a licensed local primary insurer to write a piece of business (which is otherwise produced or controlled by him) with the specific understanding that the entire risk would be transferred to him by way of reinsurance.",Released,Info-M 2.1, , ,_2022x_1_eb7034d_1690314626156_640813_162248,AF_IM 2.x,AF_IM 2.x::ACORD Information Model 2.11::Agreement::Financial Services Agreement Subtypes::FrontingAgreement,Class,Info-M 2.1,Info-M 2.5,Info-M 2.1,acordGlossaryTerm,AF_IM 2.x::ACORD Information Model 2.11::Agreement::FinancialServicesAgreement,

Insurable Interest Code List Key Person,"This concept gives information on a person's profile in a key person insurance context.  

Key person insurance is a particular type of life insurance policy taken out by a company on one of their employees, in which the company is the beneficiary in the case of that employee's untimely demise. Key person insurance is a relatively new phenomenon, but has attracted much praise and is encouraged by many strategic advisors. Life insurance is basically a system by which a fixed amount of money is paid to a beneficiary in the event that the person being covered dies. Most life insurance companies offer a type of key person insurance, as it has become more and more necessary in the modern business world.  

There are four categories of loss for which key person insurance can provide compensation: 
1. Losses related to the extended period when a key person is unable to work, to provide temporary personnel and, if necessary to finance the recruitment and training of a replacement. 
2. Insurance to protect profits. For example, offsetting lost income from lost sales, losses resulting from the delay or cancellation of any business project that the key person was involved in, loss of opportunity to expand, loss of specialized skills or knowledge.  
3. Insurance to protect shareholders or partnership interests. Typically this is insurance to enable shareholdings or partnership interests to be purchased by existing shareholders or partners.  
4. Insurance for anyone involved in guaranteeing business loans or banking facilities. The value of insurance coverage is arranged to equal the value of the guarantee. A key person can be anyone directly associated with the business whose loss can cause financial strain to the business. For example, the person could be a director of the company, a partner, a key sales person, key project manager, or someone with specific skills or knowledge which is especially valuable to the company.",Released,Info-M 2.2, , ,_2022x_1_eb7034d_1690314627763_302644_173395,AF_IM 2.x,AF_IM 2.x::ACORD Information Model 2.11::Agreement::Agreement Code Lists::InsurableInterestCodeList::Key Person,EnumerationLiteral,Info-M 2.2,Info-M 2.2,Info-M 2.4,acordGlossaryTerm, ,

Interest Code List Key Person,"This concept gives information on a person's profile in a key person insurance context.  

Key person insurance is a particular type of life insurance policy taken out by a company on one of their employees, in which the company is the beneficiary in the case of that employee's untimely demise. Key person insurance is a relatively new phenomenon, but has attracted much praise and is encouraged by many strategic advisors. Life insurance is basically a system by which a fixed amount of money is paid to a beneficiary in the event that the person being covered dies. Most life insurance companies offer a type of key person insurance, as it has become more and more necessary in the modern business world.  

There are four categories of loss for which key person insurance can provide compensation: 
1. Losses related to the extended period when a key person is unable to work, to provide temporary personnel and, if necessary to finance the recruitment and training of a replacement. 
2. Insurance to protect profits. For example, offsetting lost income from lost sales, losses resulting from the delay or cancellation of any business project that the key person was involved in, loss of opportunity to expand, loss of specialized skills or knowledge.  
3. Insurance to protect shareholders or partnership interests. Typically this is insurance to enable shareholdings or partnership interests to be purchased by existing shareholders or partners.  
4. Insurance for anyone involved in guaranteeing business loans or banking facilities. The value of insurance coverage is arranged to equal the value of the guarantee. A key person can be anyone directly associated with the business whose loss can cause financial strain to the business. For example, the person could be a director of the company, a partner, a key sales person, key project manager, or someone with specific skills or knowledge which is especially valuable to the company.",Released,Info-M 2.7, , ,_2022x_1_eb7034d_1690314630749_694006_196128,AF_IM 2.x,AF_IM 2.x::ACORD Information Model 2.11::Agreement::Agreement Code Lists::InterestCodeList::Key Person,EnumerationLiteral,Info-M 2.2,Info-M 2.7,Info-M 2.4,acordGlossaryTerm, ,

For example, assume that a claims-made policy with a January 1, 2015-2016, term contains tail coverage with a term of January 1, 2016-2017. Also assume that the insured did not renew the policy when it expired on January 1, 2016. Under the tail coverage, the insured will be able to report claims to the insurer during the January 1, 2016-2017, period of tail coverage, provided the claim resulted from a wrongful act that took place during the expired January 1, 2015-2016, policy term. 

Tail coverage, which is synonymous with extended reporting period provisions, includes several important features: (1) the coverage applies only if the wrongful act giving rise to the reported claim took place during the expired/canceled policy period. Thus, there is no tail coverage available for wrongful acts if committed during the period of tail coverage. (2) Tail coverage applies for a limited time period, generally 1 year.

A person might experience a fire and as a result, have an added expense for temporary housing/lodging until the person's residence is again habitable.

Organization Defining Party Role Relationship,"This represents a party role relationship that defines an organization.

e.g. If a company acquires group health insurance for its employees, there is a need to make clear the parties that are part of the ""group"" with an awareness that not all members of the group may opt-in for health insurance, they are simply part of the group for whom the insurance was pursued. Here, the ""group"" may be viewed as singular with an awareness there are likely many persons who are part of this group.

This represents the applicable type of legal entity. A legal entity is a party (person or organization) that has the legal capability of entering into a contract with another entity. Essentially, this status makes it possible for a properly incorporated organization to function in the same manner that an individual can, when it comes to entering into binding contracts for all types of goods and services. Along with the ability to legally establish contractual relationships with others, the entity has the responsibility of upholding the terms and conditions of those agreements, or risking the possibility of being sued for failing to honor those contractual obligations.&#160; 

    </p>

    <p>
&#160;

    </p>

    <p>
Just about any type of incorporated business or organization can be considered a legal entity. This includes companies that operate for profit, non-profit associations and other groups, partnerships, and even trust funds. When a business or other organization complies with the requirements put in place by the jurisdiction where it is established, it is normally treated as if the business or organization was an individual. This is true when it comes to matters like paying taxes, obtaining business or operating licenses, and engaging in any type of legal actions.&#160;&#160; 

    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
One key benefit of being defined as a legal entity is that this status makes it possible for legal action to be brought against the company, rather than against the people who own and operate the organization.&#160;&#160; 

      </li>
      <li>
A corporation sole is a legal entity in which one person and his or her subsequent successors are granted the lawful status of a corporation.

A Cross-sell score indicates the probability of purchasing products not currently held with a particular provider, for example buying home contents insurance from an insurance company with which term life insurance is already held. 

An Up-sell score indicates the probability of upgrading a currently held product, for example, increasing the sum assured (face amount) under a life policy. 

A Retention score indicates the probability of a customer terminating their relationship with the modeled organization in whole or in part, for example surrendering an endowment policy.

Property Coverage Coinsurance Percent,"Coinsurance is a penalty imposed on the insured by the insurer for under reporting/declaring/insuring the value of tangible property or business income. The penalty is based on a percentage stated within the policy and the amount under reported.

As an example:
A building actually valued at $1,000,000 has an 80% coinsurance clause but is insured for only $750,000. Since its insured value is less than 80% of its actual value, when it suffers a loss, the insurance payout will be subject to the underreporting penalty. For example: It suffers a $200,000 loss. The insured would recover $750,000 Ã· (.80 Ã— 1,000,000) Ã— 200,000 = $187,500 (less any deductible).

In this example the underreporting penalty would be $12,500.

The most commonly issued coinsurance percentage would be 80% but can be as high as 100%. The latter[100%] would impose the greatest penalty for under reporting. For this reason, it is vital that values of property are accurately reported and updated annually to reflect inflation and other increases in cost.",Released,Info-M 2.4,Wikipedia, ,_2022x_1_eb7034d_1690314628994_161350_183076,AF_IM 2.x,AF_IM 2.x::ACORD Information Model 2.11::Agreement::Agreement Component Subtypes::PropertyCoverage::coinsurancePercent,Property,Info-M 2.4,Info-M 2.4,Info-M 2.4,acordGlossaryTerm, ,

Proportional Treaty Agreement Commission Rate,"The commission paid by the reinsurer to the ceding company (primary insurer) on reinsurance agreements as compensation to place the business with the reinsurer and to cover the ceding company's acquisition expenses.

Also called Ceding commission or Exchange commission. The pricing mechanism (expressed as a percentage of premium ceded) under a proportional reinsurance contract, whereby the ceding company recoups the reinsurer's pro rata share of its original costs from the reinsurer (and, in addition, sometimes claims a margin for good will or presumptive profit). The cedent's original costs are comprised of acquisition costs (direct commission, brokerage) and management expenses (on risk inspection, issue of policies, underwriting, accounting, claims processing etc.) Commission is payable only under proportional reinsurance - whether facultative or treaty. The reason is that, under the proportional method, the reinsurer shares premiums with the cedent in direct proportion to his share of the sum insured and must likewise share the costs. Under the excess of loss method, there is no such sharing and the premium charged to the reassured is a net price related to the quantum of protection. If commission is only meant to recover actual original costs, it can be calculated easily. However, in practice, it is a pricing mechanism whereby the cedent tries to earn the highest possible reward for producing, controlling and managing a book of business which is then given in a packaged form to the reinsurer. The rate of commission therefore includes a premium for quality based on the merits and performance of the portfolio ceded. Commission terms vary, depending on basis of cession (OGR or ONR). In fixing the margin over and above original costs, the factors taken into account are the balance of the treaty, the track record of the treaty and future loss potential, extent of anti-selection against the reinsurer, types of risks and perils ceded, market norms for each class / treaty type, type of treaty, , whether treaty is traded reciprocally, cash flow potential, special relationship if any with the reinsurer, cost of administration of the treaty and, finally, the law of supply and demand.

Proportional Treaty Agreement Profit Commission Rate,"Also known as Contingent commission.
This is an amount which the reinsurer agrees to pay to the reassured (usually under a proportional treaty and very rarely under a non-proportional treaty) as an incentive by way of profit participation. The results are arrived at after deduction from earned premium of losses incurred, ceding commission, taxes & charges (but not brokerage) and an allowance for the reinsurer's management expenses (the M/E factor). Losses, if any, are carried forward to the computation of profit for a specified count of subsequent years or until extinction. A separate statement has to be prepared for each reinsurer because, apart from differences in ceding commission and rate of profit commission (as, for example, in the case of the Lead Reinsurer or a reciprocal reinsurer), only those losses may be carried forward which relate to the participation of a particular reinsurer in previous years. A new reinsurer cannot claim credit for losses carried forward relating to the outgoing reinsurer whom he has replaced. The commission may be a fixed percentage of the profit or calculated on a sliding scale. It is important for the cedent to render a profit commission statement within a reasonable time after rendering of accounts for the final quarter, even if the result is a loss because otherwise accounts would be incomplete and the loss to be carried forward will not be recorded. This also facilitates maintenance of cumulative treaty statistics over a period of years. Reinsurers would prefer allowing a generous profit commission to a higher basic commission. The rate is influenced by various factors - such as: - whether the treaty is well-established and has a clear pattern of past profitability or is unbalanced, with the dangerous potential that profits earned over several good years may be wiped out by a huge loss in a single year, - whether there is a substantial exposure to catastrophic losses (riots, elemental perils), thus requiring the reinsurer to incur additional costs on excess of loss protection for his share, - whether the treaty is placed on reciprocal basis or is placed as a bouquet supported by a book of more profitable business and - whether the basic commission itself incorporates a profit incentive (as discussed earlier). Where various treaties are placed together on 'bouquet' basis, profit commission is usually calculated on the combined results of the bouquet. Likewise, where a treaty is comprised of more than one section (Quota Share / Surplus, Domestic / Foreign risks, different sub-classes such as under General Accident). Calculation of profits under a bouquet becomes a bit of a problem if it contains long tail business such as Marine Cargo, CAR/EAR or liability. There is a theory which holds that no profit commission should be allowed under a quota share treaty as the results and interests of both parties under such a treaty are already the same (i.e. they share in both good and bad business) and there is no need for a further monetary inducement to the cedent for better management of the portfolio. The position under a surplus treaty is different as the cedent is in a position to influence the fortunes of the surpluses ceded without participating in the results. Profit commission is not usually allowed under automatic facultative and facultative obligatory treaties, where results tend to fluctuate widely and there is a potential for periodical heavy deficits. The objective in fixing the rate of profit commission would be to ensure that, combined with the basic commission; it does not eat up an unreasonable portion of the profit. The reinsurer should be allowed to retain an adequate margin in return for the risk he has run and in order that he is enabled to set aside reserves to finance the deficit in bad years. In order to achieve some flexibility on this front, it is common practice to have sliding scale or stepped up scales based on the profit ratio. While the ratio of profit for purposes of the formula is based on earned premium, the rate profit commission payable is applied to written premium.",Released,Info-M 2.1, , ,_2022x_1_eb7034d_1690314625702_782878_158639,AF_IM 2.x,AF_IM 2.x::ACORD Information Model 2.11::Agreement::Reinsurance Treaty Agreement Subtypes::ProportionalTreatyAgreement::profitCommissionRate,Property,Info-M 2.1,Info-M 2.3,Info-M 2.3,acordGlossaryTerm, ,

Quota share reinsurance is an automatic reinsurance that requires the insurer to transfer, and the reinsurer to accept, a given percentage of every risk within a defined category of business written by the insurer. For example, in the case of a 20% quota share, the insurer transfers 20% of its liability and premiums on every risk to the reinsurer, who must pay 20% of any loss sustained, whether total or partial. The percentage is constant throughout and applies to premiums and losses alike.",Released,Info-M 2.1, , ,_2022x_1_eb7034d_1690314626847_684343_166660,AF_IM 2.x,AF_IM 2.x::ACORD Information Model 2.11::Agreement::Reinsurance Treaty Agreement Subtypes::QuotaShareTreatyAgreement,Class,Info-M 2.1,Info-M 2.5,Info-M 2.1,acordGlossaryTerm,AF_IM 2.x::ACORD Information Model 2.11::Agreement::Reinsurance Treaty Agreement Subtypes::ProportionalTreatyAgreement,

Building Code Effectiveness Grading: In Brief:&#160;&#160; 

    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
The Building Code Effectiveness Grading Schedule (BCEGS) assesses the building codes in effect in a particular community and how the community enforces its building codes, with special emphasis on mitigation of losses from natural hazards.&#160; 

      </li>
      <li>
The concept is simple: municipalities with effective codes that are well enforced should demonstrate better loss experience, and insurance rates can reflect that. The process of lessening catastrophe related damage and ultimately lowering insurance costs provides an incentive for communities to enforce their building codes rigorously, especially as they relate to windstorm and earthquake damage.&#160; 

      </li>
      <li>
The anticipated upshot: safer buildings, less damage and lower insured losses from catastrophes.&#160;&#160; 

      </li>
      <li>
The BCEGS program will assign each graded municipality a BCEGS grade of 1 (best) to 10 (no recognized building code enforcement).

Reinsurance Agreement,"This concept represents the agreement between a cedent and a reinsurer.

The two basic methods of reinsurance are Facultative and Treaty. Within the scope of each of these two methods, there are two broad types - Proportional (or contributing) reinsurance and Non-Proportional (or non-contributing) reinsurance.
Facultative reinsurance is an optional method, under which the direct insurer (ceding company or cedent) offers each risk individually to the reinsurer for his consideration. The reinsurer consequently receives full details of each risk offered, as he would if he were to write it on a direct basis, and he has the option to reject the offer or to agree to acceptance on such terms and conditions as he may prescribe. The offer and acceptance are thus optional on both sides, and there is no valid contract until and unless the offer is accepted. 
Treaty reinsurance is an obligatory method based on an agreement concluded for a specified period of time (usually 12-month period, renewable annually) covering a defined concept or concepts of business. Details of individual risks are not provided (barring exceptional cases providing for submission of bordereaux). The cedent is obliged to cede all risks falling within the scope of the agreement, and the reinsurer is obliged to accept all such cessions without the option to decline or to ask for improved terms. Offer and acceptance are thus automatic, and the offer becomes a contract as soon as it is made (rather than as soon as it is accepted - as under the facultative method).

Proportional (synonyms: share reinsurance or pro rata reinsurance) and Non-proportional reinsurance:
Under proportional reinsurance, the cedent and the reinsurer share the original risk on pro rata basis, and they also share the premiums and claims in the same proportion. This concept could be applied to an individual risk (facultative) or to a number of risks covered by a single contract (treaty). There is thus a complete community of interest between the parties to the contract.

Basic methods and types of reinsurance: 
 Facultative:
 - Proportional = Proportional facultative
 - Non-Proportional = Risk Excess, Layered Cover, Facultative Stop Loss
 Treaty:
 - Proportional = Quota Share, Surplus, Combined Quota-cum-Surplus
 - Non-Proportional = Per Risk Excess of Loss, Working Excess of Loss, Catastrophe Excess of Loss, Aggregate Excess of Loss (Stop Loss)
 Semi-automatic arrangements:
 - Proportional = Automatic Facultative Cover, Facultative Obligatory Cover, Line Slip
 - Non-Proportional = Coded Excess of Loss, Excess of Loss Line Slip

Inception date = Commencement date of the contract.
Expiration date = Date of cessation of a reinsurance cover, when the time period for which it was written has ended. A treaty written on a ""continuous until canceled"" basis does not expire automatically but will contain a provision for termination.",Released,Info-M 2.1, , ,_2022x_1_eb7034d_1690314626422_495495_163820,AF_IM 2.x,AF_IM 2.x::ACORD Information Model 2.11::Agreement::Financial Services Agreement Subtypes::ReinsuranceAgreement,Class,Info-M 2.1,Info-M 2.10,Info-M 2.3,acordGlossaryTerm,AF_IM 2.x::ACORD Information Model 2.11::Agreement::Financial Services Agreement Subtypes::InsuranceAgreement,

Reinsurance Brokerage,"This concept states an organization's role as a reinsurance brokerage.

Legislation in most countries requires authorization of direct producers (both agents and brokers) and regulation of their activities. No such restrictions have applied historically to reinsurance brokers for two reasons: 
a) Reinsurance broking is an activity which extends beyond national borders (often involving two countries, where co-broking is done with correspondent brokers) and, if it were to be regulated, it would be subject to numerous jurisdictions, and 
b) Regulatory legislation is prompted by concern for the security of retail insurance customers and the public in general. Reinsurance contracts do not involve this concern as they are agreements between two professionals with expert knowledge of the business transacted by them. This situation is however changing to some extent and regulations are being framed to cover: 
- minimum capital requirements, 
- minimum solvency margin, 
- proof of adequate professional indemnity insurance coverage (based on turnover, with a ceiling on maximum permitted self-insured deductible), 
- proof of professional insurance qualifications of the directors, 
- segregation of own funds from fiduciary funds, 
- submission of prescribed audited returns to the regulator, and access of regulatory authorities for inspection of records.

Historically, reinsurance brokers have played a significant role in the development of London as a global reinsurance center. The majority of London reinsurance brokers are subsidiaries of larger direct producer and risk management groups but operate quite independently, some being specialized in certain concepts of business. Owing to the international scope of their activities, many travel extensively and some even maintain a network of overseas offices in addition to regular dealing with correspondent brokers in other countries. The role and functions of the reinsurance broker cover a wide field: 
- Collection and dissemination of up-to-date market intelligence as also firsthand information on individual companies so as to enhance the marketing base of participating cedents and reinsurers, 
- Technical assistance to cedents (inspection and rating of peak or complicated risks, drawing up of policy wordings and clauses, survey and processing of claims, fixing of retentions and treaty limits, devising of cost-effective reinsurance programs, screening of security of reinsurers and maintenance of an early warning system against potential defaults and bankruptcies),
- Negotiation of lead terms and quotes that are equitable and fair so as to ensure continuity and long term support from first concept security,
- Spreading the placement across a wide international spectrum with due regard to the special capabilities and expertise of various markets, 
- Conduct of renewal negotiations and reciprocal trading terms,
- Assistance in preparation and transmission of contract documents, accounts, reports and loss advices, 
- Assistance in settlement of bilateral accounts, currency management and investment of funds overseas, 
- Assistance in resolution of disputes, including the conduct of arbitration proceedings and court action - especially in case of existence of a language barrier or disputes between the countries of domicile of the parties to a dispute (the neutrality of the broker being an invaluable aid in avoiding otherwise delicate or embarrassing confrontations), 
- Technical aid in development of new or complex concepts of business, 
- Assistance in training of the staff of cedents, 
- Assistance in implementing latest available technology tools (including IT tools) for upgrading internal administrative and accounting procedures of the cedent and

Risk Excess Facultative Agreement,"Reinsurance and retained limits apply per risk as opposed to per occurrence or in the aggregate. Use of this method for placement of extremely large or complex risks has been given an impetus by:
- Insufficient proportional capacity in the international reinsurance market,
- Disparities between the original rate and the global rate expected by reinsurers, and 
- The drive by insurers to optimize efficient deployment of capital by maximizing retention. 

Under this method, the loss potential of a single risk from any one loss into two layers above and below the Excess Point:
- Underlying Layer (Deductible or Loss Retention or Priority) - portion of each loss retained by the reassured on a first loss basis); and
- Limit of Indemnity - the excess over the Deductible borne by the Reinsurer up to a stipulated limit.

The subject matter insured is the Ultimate Net Loss, which is defined as meaning all sums actually paid by the Reinsured in respect of the loss including expenses of litigation and all other loss expenses but excluding office expenses and salaries of his employees. Salvages, third party recoveries and collections under prior proportional reinsurances shall first be deducted.

The Risk Excess is distinct from Per Risk Excess of Loss and Working Excess of Loss, which are treaty methods employed for protection of all the individual risks comprised in a whole defined portfolio - rather than a specified individual risk.

The trigger for attachment of Reinsurer's liability under a Risk Excess is each loss. It is accordingly necessary to define this term because an accumulation of otherwise separate but arguably simultaneous losses can be caused by a single event (such as a riot or a natural calamity) affecting one and the same risk. Whereas a loss occurrence is defined in both temporal and spatial terms under the Hours Clause, all that is required under a Risk Excess is a temporal definition as the area covered is the specific location of the risk. 

If the Risk Excess method is used to handle a risk which itself is originally insured on First Loss basis for a fraction of the theoretical Value at Risk, the Indemnity may be so pegged that, when added to the Deductible, the resulting total is equivalent to the First Loss Limit of Liability relating to the facultative portion - regardless of the Value at Risk. However, if the risk is insured for the full Value at Risk (Total Sum Insured) but is underwritten on a Probable Maximum Loss (PML) basis, it must be remembered that the insurer is nevertheless liable up to the full TSI - plus costs such as survey and adjustment charges, legal fees etc. Therefore, where there is a possibility of PML error, the Indemnity is stretched further - often up to the full TSI - by purchasing a relatively cheap sleep easy top layer.",Released,Info-M 2.1, , ,_2022x_1_eb7034d_1690314627606_234974_172234,AF_IM 2.x,AF_IM 2.x::ACORD Information Model 2.11::Agreement::Reinsurance Facultative Agreement Subtypes::RiskExcessFacultativeAgreement,Class,Info-M 2.1,Info-M 2.5,Info-M 2.6,acordGlossaryTerm,AF_IM 2.x::ACORD Information Model 2.11::Agreement::Reinsurance Facultative Agreement Subtypes::ProportionalFacultativeAgreement,

Self Insured Retention (SIR),"Self-insured retentions (SIRs) and deductibles are similar in that both require the insured to bear financial responsibility for a portion of a loss and, in this regard, represent an exposure that is not covered by insurance. However, there are important differences in the way they operate.
 
Insurance policies written with deductibles provide that the insurer will pay the defense and indemnity costs in connection with a covered claim, and then charge or bill back the deductible amount to the insured. In other words, the ""deductible"" is a sum that is subtracted from the insurer's indemnity and/or defense obligation under the policy. Importantly, the responsibility for the defense and settlement of each claim rests solely with the insurer, and the insurer maintains control over the entire claim process.
 
Policies written with large self-insured retentions, in contrast, may place responsibility for claims handling, including the investigation, settlement and payment of claims, in the hands of the insured. Under a policy with an SIR, the insured is typically required to pay the defense and other allocated expense costs as well as indemnity payments until the amount of the retention has been exhausted. Once the SIR has been exhausted, the insurer responds to the loss and assumes control of the claim.
 
Self-insured retentions are distinct from deductibles in at least one important respect: The insured whose coverage is subject to a self-insured retention generally is obligated to retain its own defense counsel. Indeed, in a self-insurance arrangement the claims-handling generally is controlled by the insured, an independent adjusting company, or a primary insurer's claim department retained by the insured to assist it in claim management. In essence, a self-insured is the primary insurer. Not surprisingly, many insureds that employ self-insurance are major companies or commercial entities, sophisticated in matters of insurance, risk management, and loss control.
 
Another difference between a deductible and an SIR is that the SIR does not reduce available policy limits, whereas a deductible may reduce policy limits. Thus, an excess insurance contract with limits of $750,000 sitting above a $250,000 SIR will provide the insured with $750,000 in coverage once the SIR is satisfied. A $250,000 deductible, in contrast, may reduce the $750,000 insurance policy limits, leaving $500,000 in limits after the deductible is satisfied.
 
An SIR is generally a specific amount of loss that is not covered by the policy but instead must be borne by the insured. An SIR endorsement may provide that the insurer shall have the right, but not the duty, to assume charge of the defense and settlement of any claim, including those below the level of the SIR.
 
One of the key characteristics of an SIR is that the insurer has no obligation to indemnify or defend a loss until the insured has paid the amount of the SIR. For purposes of analyzing the effect of ""other insurance"" clauses, this characteristic is the most significant characteristic of an SIR because it is this characteristic that transforms what would otherwise be a primary policy into an ""excess"" policy.
 
The magnitude of the difference between SIRs and deductibles depends upon the precise policy terms. Most significantly, the insured with an SIR generally assumes responsibility for claims handling and will report to the insurer only those claims that it considers likely to exceed the amount of its retained limit. By contrast, in the case of liability policies with a deductible, claims are tendered to the insurer for handling.",Released,Info-M 2.5,PropertyCasualty360.com, ,_2022x_1_eb7034d_1690314626695_36898_165372,AF_IM 2.x,AF_IM 2.x::ACORD Information Model 2.11::Agreement::Agreement Component Subtypes::SelfInsuredRetentionComponent,Class,Info-M 2.5,Info-M 2.5,Info-M 2.5,acordGlossaryTerm,AF_IM 2.x::ACORD Information Model 2.11::Agreement::Agreement Component Subtypes::RetentionComponent,

The stop loss method protects the cedent against the possibility that the aggregate value of an accumulation of small losses will exceed a specified percentage of earned premium income of a particular class. Stop loss reinsurance is the exact opposite of the quota share reinsurance and surplus reinsurance, and differs considerably from other forms of excess of loss reinsurance.

Surplus Share Treaty Agreement,"Surplus Share Treaty is a Proportional treaty.
Surplus reinsurance is an automatic reinsurance that requires an insurer to transfer (cede) and the reinsurer to accept the part of every risk that exceeds the insurer's predetermined retention limit. The reinsurer shares in premiums and losses in the same proportion as it shares in the total policy limits of the risk. The surplus method permits the insurer to keep for its own account small policies, and to transfer the amount of risk on large policies above its retention limit. For example, assume an insurer issues a policy for $20,000 (limit of insurance). The insurer keeps $5000 (this is the threshold amount) (Â¼) and transfers the remaining $15,000 (Â¾) to its reinsurer. This is called a three line surplus because the amount transferred equals three times the retained line of the insurer. The insurer keeps Â¼ and transfers Â¾ of the premium to the reinsurer. In the event of total loss, the settlements between the insurer and the reinsurer would be effected on the identical Â¼-Â¾ basis. The same principal applies if there is a partial loss, in that the reinsurer must reimburse the insurer in the same proportion as the reinsurance premium received.",Released,Info-M 2.1, , ,_2022x_1_eb7034d_1690314625050_228178_152744,AF_IM 2.x,AF_IM 2.x::ACORD Information Model 2.11::Agreement::Reinsurance Treaty Agreement Subtypes::SurplusShareTreatyAgreement,Class,Info-M 2.1,Info-M 2.5,Info-M 2.5,acordGlossaryTerm,AF_IM 2.x::ACORD Information Model 2.11::Agreement::Reinsurance Treaty Agreement Subtypes::ProportionalTreatyAgreement,

Telecommunication Address Local Number,"The local number (or subscriber number) must always be dialed in its entirety. The first few digits in the local number typically indicate smaller geographical areas or individual telephone exchanges. In mobile networks they may indicate a network provider in case the area code does not. Callers from a number with a given area/country code usually do not need to (but optionally may) include the particular area/country code in the number dialed, which enables shorter ""dial strings"" to be used. Devices that dial phone numbers automatically can include the full number with area and access codes, since there is no additional annoyance related to dialing extra digits.

Telex messages are routed by addressing them to a telex address, e.g., ""14910 ERIC S"", where 14910 is the subscriber number, ERIC is an abbreviation for the subscriber's name (in this case Telefonaktiebolaget L.M. Ericsson in Sweden) and S is the country code. Solutions also exist for the automatic routing of messages to different telex terminals within a subscriber organization, by using different terminal identities, e.g., ""+T148"".

Treaty Reinsurance Agreement,"A reinsurance treaty is a reinsurance convention between an insurer and a reinsurer defining the terms under which the risks covered by the convention are ceded and accepted.

The two main categories of treaty reinsurance are proportional and non-proportional. 

Treaty reinsurance is an obligatory method based on an agreement concluded for a specified period of time (usually 12-month period, renewable annually) covering a defined concept or concepts of business. Details of individual risks are not provided (barring exceptional cases providing for submission of bordereaux). The cedent is obliged to cede all risks falling within the scope of the agreement, and the reinsurer is obliged to accept all such cessions without the option to decline or to ask for improved terms. Offer and acceptance are thus automatic, and the offer becomes a contract as soon as it is made (rather than as soon as it is accepted - as under the facultative method).

This concept is the parent concept for the different treaty concepts.
Treaty:
- Proportional = Quota Share, Surplus, Combined Quota-cum-Surplus
- Non-Proportional = Per Risk Excess of Loss, Working Excess of Loss, Catastrophe Excess of Loss, Aggregate Excess of Loss (Stop Loss)",Released,Info-M 2.1, , ,_2022x_1_eb7034d_1690314631307_847094_199940,AF_IM 2.x,AF_IM 2.x::ACORD Information Model 2.11::Agreement::Reinsurance Agreement Subtypes::TreatyReinsuranceAgreement,Class,Info-M 2.1,Info-M 2.6,Info-M 2.4,acordGlossaryTerm,AF_IM 2.x::ACORD Information Model 2.11::Agreement::Financial Services Agreement Subtypes::ReinsuranceAgreement,

On July 1, $500 would have been earned and $500 would remain as unearned premium, belonging to the policyholder. If either party cancels the contract, the insurer must have the unearned premium ready to refund. For this reason, insurance regulators require that insurers maintain an unearned premium reserve so that, in the event an insurer must be liquidated, there is enough money to pay claims and refund the unearned premium.

Watercraft Specification Loaded Displacement Measurement,"A ship's displacement or displacement tonnage, a term usually applied only to naval vessels, is the weight of the water that a ship displaces when it is floating. The term is defined ordinarily such that the ship's fuel tanks are full and all stores are aboard. Displacement is the actual weight of the ship, since a floating body displaces its own weight in water (Archimedes' principle). Another way of thinking about displacement is the weight of the water that would spill out of a completely filled container were the ship placed into it. A number of synonymous terms exist for this maximum weight, such as loaded displacement, full load displacement and designated displacement.

corridor self-insured retention,"Also known as a ""bikini deductible,"" this is a self-insured layer, separating the primary layer of riskâ€”whether insured, self-insured, or funded in a captiveâ€”from the layer immediately excess of the primary. It was first used in health insurance, inserting a deductible (a real deductible, not a self-insured retention (SIR)) between a first dollar insured health plan and major medical coverage, which is excess of the primary health insurance policy. The structure resembles a bikini because there's defined protection on the bottom and on the top but nothing in the middle. Corridor SIRs migrated from health insurance to property and casualty applications when risk managers, brokers, and creative excess insurance underwriters were looking for more sophisticated methods of allocating and funding risk. Typically, the corridor SIR layer is unfunded. It's used to lower the cost of (or provide access to) excess or umbrella insurance, while relieving the insured from the requirement to fund for expected losses. It is also used in structured insurance arrangements. Corridor SIRs can be designed to cover non-aggregated per occurrence limits or a combination of per occurrence and aggregate limits. A typical corridor SIR will include per occurrence limits perhaps subject to an annual aggregate, depending on the risk and the excess insurance pricing.",Released,Glos-M 2.7, ,Bikini Deductible,_2022x_1_eb7034d_1690314626435_973172_163892,Glossary Of Terms,AF_Glossary 2.x::ACORD Business Glossary 2.13::C::corridor self-insured retention,Glossary Term,Glos-M 2.7,,Glos-M 2.7,acordGlossaryTerm, ,
